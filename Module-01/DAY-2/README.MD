# Ex.No:1(B) VARIABLES AND OPERATOR

## AIM:
The values of variables 'a' and 'b' are 6 and 8 respectively, write a Java programs to swap the values of the two variables by without using a third variable. After swapping the values should be a= 8 b=6

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start

2. Declare two integer variables a and b

3. Initialize a = 6, b = 8

4. To swap without a third variable:

   a = a + b

   b = a - b

   a = a - b

5. Print the values of a and b after swapping

6. End





## PROGRAM:
 ```

```

## Sourcecode.java:

```
public class Demo
{
    public static void main(String[] args){
    int a = 6;
    int b = 8;
    System.out.println("After swapping a= "+b +" b="+a);
    }
}

```

## OUTPUT:
After swapping a = 8  b = 6



## RESULT:
The values of a and b have been successfully swapped without using a third variable.
